Sergiy V. Bokhnyak's submission for Hubertus Franke OS class Spring 2016.

All code written in C++, I get a perfect output, with no difference 
between sample output and my output, when I test it
though I did not compare verbose versions.

compile: g++ scheduler.gpp
run____: ./a.out [-v] -s[type] [inputfile] [randfile]

Follows format given by assignment instructions^^.
